/**
 * Represents an LMDB environment, which is the container for all database operations.
 * 
 * An LMDB environment supports multiple databases, all residing in the same shared-memory map.
 * It must be created before any other operations can be performed. The environment handle
 * is used to configure settings, create transactions, and manage the database lifecycle.
 *
 * The Env class wraps the MDB_env structure from the native LMDB library.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - All databases share the same memory map managed by this environment
 * - Supports multiple simultaneous read transactions
 * - Allows a single write transaction at a time
 * - Provides full ACID semantics
 * - Manages resources like memory maps and lock files
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * val env = Env()
 * env.maxDatabases = 10u
 * env.mapSize = (10 * 1024 * 1024).toULong() // 10MB
 * env.open("/path/to/database", EnvOption.NoTLS, EnvOption.NoSubDir)
 * 
 * // Create a transaction
 * env.beginTxn().use { txn ->
 *     // Open a database in the environment
 *     val db = txn.dbiOpen("mydb", DbiOption.Create)
 *     // Perform operations...
 *     txn.commit()
 * }
 * 
 * env.close()
 * ```
 *
 * The environment must be properly closed with [close] when no longer needed
 * to release all resources.
