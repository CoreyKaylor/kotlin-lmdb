/**
 * Represents a database handle in the LMDB environment.
 *
 * A database handle denotes the name and parameters of a database,
 * independently of whether such a database exists. The handle may be discarded
 * by calling [close].
 *
 * The Dbi class wraps the MDB_dbi handle from the native LMDB library.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Each database within an environment is identified by its handle
 * - Can be named or unnamed (the default/unnamed database)
 * - Supports various configuration options like duplicate keys, key ordering, etc.
 * - Multiple databases in the same environment share the same memory map
 * - Can have custom key and data comparison functions
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * env.beginTxn().use { txn ->
 *     // Open a database in the environment
 *     val db = txn.dbiOpen("mydb", DbiOption.Create, DbiOption.DupSort)
 *     
 *     // Use the database...
 *     
 *     txn.commit()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note: Database handles are owned by the environment after a successful commit.
 * They can be used by future transactions until explicitly closed.
