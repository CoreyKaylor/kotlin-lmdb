/**
 * Represents an LMDB transaction, which provides a consistent view of the database.
 *
 * All database operations require a transaction handle. Transactions can be read-only
 * or read-write. Multiple read-only transactions can run concurrently, but only one
 * write transaction can be active at any point in time.
 *
 * The Txn class wraps the MDB_txn structure from the native LMDB library.
 *
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Required for all database operations
 * - Provides ACID guarantees
 * - Can be read-only or read-write
 * - Can be nested (child transactions)
 * - Thread-confined: must only be used by a single thread
 * - Automatically managed via Kotlin's use() function due to implementing AutoCloseable
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * env.beginTxn().use { txn ->
 *     val db = txn.dbiOpen("mydb", DbiOption.Create)
 *     txn.put(db, "key".toByteArray().toVal(), "value".toByteArray().toVal())
 *     txn.commit()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For read-only operations:
 * ```
 * env.beginTxn(TxnOption.ReadOnly).use { txn ->
 *     val db = txn.dbiOpen("mydb")
 *     val result = txn.get(db, "key".toByteArray().toVal())
 *     // No need to commit read-only transactions, they'll be aborted on close
 * }
 * ```
